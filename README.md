# Drone Operator Behavior Models through HMM
This is the code for develeping human operator behavior models through HMMs, to further study the impact of operators’ drone control strategies as a function of differing levels of autonomy. Details are shown in the paper The Impact of Different Levels of Autonomy and Training on Operators’ Drone Control Strategies.
